# ClumpUs Front End

Front end for my Capstone project for the Bottega FullStack Development Certificate.

ClumpUs is a live chat app that allows users to chat with an individual or a group. Users can create an account, send messages in real time, and upload a profile picture and bio to be viewed by other users.

Check it out here: [ClumpUs](https://bottega-capstone-client.vercel.app/home)

Built with React, using Vite as the starter template.
